# PokiDex
This code is writtem as a code test submission. The the directives has shown I have implemented
### 1. Favorite Pokemon Animal
### 2. The Update of Favorite Pokemon Animal
### 3. The viewing of all the Pokemon Animals, which can be filtered by type and sorted in any order

In addtion to the above, I have added Context API to store the favorite list, and SWR to request and store API responses. 
I have chosen Bootstrap as my UI library eventhough I started it with Material UI. The PokeAPI had about 1281 Pokemons, I learned
alot about pokemons and most importantly Pagination as it was a challenge to display the 65 pages :)
